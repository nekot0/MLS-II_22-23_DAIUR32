## About this repository

This repository is part of the assignment of Applied Machine Learning Systems II (ELEC0135_22-23). There are two files in the jupyter notebook format. Each file can be run on Kaggle platform. 



## Descriptions

### file 1 ([run on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nekot0/effdet-simpletest))

This code is a test implementation of training the EfficientDet model using effdet, a pytorch-based implementation of EfficientDet. It deals with a task in a simple setting where the imput images have one red circle on a black square background. The model is trained to output the potential bounding boxes for a red circle. 

This code is based on [the blog article](https://endaaman.me/tips/training-effcientdet-pytorch), and my contribution is explained in [this article](https://dev.to/nekot0/efficientdet-implementation-in-a-simple-setting-4em3) written by myself.
